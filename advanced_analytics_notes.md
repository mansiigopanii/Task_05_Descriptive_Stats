## ðŸ”¬ Advanced Analytics â€“ Final Summary

### âœ… New Metrics Created:
- Win %
- FT Made per Game
- Turnovers per Game
- FT%
- Efficiency Score = Wins + FG% + FT%

### ðŸ“Š Key Findings:
- South Carolina was undefeated (100% Win %) and among top 5 for FG%.
- LSU had the highest Free Throws Made per Game (20.1).
- Indiana led the league in Field Goal % (50.4).
- Iowa had the highest Efficiency Score (161.6).
- Alabama St. had the highest Turnovers/Game (22.9).

### ðŸ¤– ChatGPT Comparison:
- GPT accurately answered all top-5 ranking questions.
- GPT correctly reasoned correlation between FG% and Wins.
- GPT identified South Carolina, Indiana, Iowa as standout teams.

### ðŸ“ˆ Charts Generated:
- Correlation Matrix: `advanced_correlation_heatmap.png`
- FT% vs Win %: `ft_vs_win_percent.png`
- Assists vs Win %: `assist_vs_win_percent.png`

### ðŸ§  Insights:
- High FG% and AssistPerGame are strong predictors of Win %.
- Teams with >20 turnovers/game tend to rank low in Win %.
- Efficient scoring teams (FG% + FT%) dominated in Win %.

### ðŸ”œ Next Steps:
- Explore clustering or PCA to group teams.
- Try linear regression to predict Win % based on features.
